## *PROBLEM STATEMENT*:
- A grocery store is facing challenges in managing their inventory, purchase orders, and sales due to the inefficiencies and errors associated with manual systems. 
- Therefore, there is a need for a Grocery Stock Management System using DBMS that can automate the process of managing inventory, purchasing, and sales. 
- The system stores the details of Product which can be characterised by Product ID, name, category, price per unit etc. 
- The Product is supplied by a Supplier (Supplier ID, name, phone number, email ID ) who receives an Order identified by Order ID,Order date, expected delivery date, total order cost.
- The other entities include customer(customer ID, name, phone number, email) , sales order(order ID, order date, total cost) and staff(staff ID, name, phone number, email ID).
